									<p>
									I was born in Mission Viejo California. The youngest of three children born into a family of hardened northern homesteaders and miners. From a young age, both my mother and father would demonstrate and instill within me a relentless work ethic that would serve me well to this day.</p>
									<p>I went to high school in Henderson Nevada where I finished in 2010. After which I chose not to attend university, yet. Instead, I would get the unfortunate chance to experience the job market at the tail end of the great recession. This experience would turn out to be valuable beyond anything I imagined. It would push me to pursue my degree in engineering and teach me the value of education, hard work, and what it means to have a rewarding career.</p>
									<p>I began my higher education at a small university located in the heart of the 2012 North Dakota oil boom. My time in the Baaken would be short lived and I soon moved on to Montana State University in Bozeman. MSU Bozeman is well known for engineering and is considered by many to be one of the top engineering schools in its region. There, I would be put through the rigorous Mechanical Engineering program and obtain my Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering in May 2018. </p>
