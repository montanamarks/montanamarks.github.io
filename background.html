									I was born in Mission Viejo California. As a child, I would always take things apart to see what made them tick.
										Sometimes, to the dismay of my family, my disassembly of a household gadget would mean its untimely demise. However, most times it was the opposite case.
										Fortunately, I grew up in a household that fostered that curiosity, and around the age of 11, I was given an empty computer tower as a gift from my father.
										I was able to scavenge the required hardware from old computers and friends whose parents worked in the computer industry. I'll never forget the day I got it to boot up.
										Throughout middle and high school, this passion for building and tinkering would continue. Later, through months of saving, was able to muster enough to get purchase a nitro-powered remote-controlled car.
										Over the following months, I would spend more time fixing it than driving it.
										However, the constant tinkering on what was essentially a miniaturized truck gave me real-world lessons on suspension systems, two-cycle engines, drivetrains, and radio-controlled systems.
										This passion would grow to the point that by the end of high school I would find myself replacing the transmission of an old truck I bought off a neighbor for $500.
										This passion would drive me to obtain my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Montana State University in 2018.
										Towards the end of my undergraduate degree, I would become increasingly interested in computer-aided engineering methods such as Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis.
										This newfound interest would lead me to pursue my Masterâ€™s degree at MSU.  My graduate research was focused on the development of a low-order fluid-structure interaction model of a torsionally compliant unmanned aerial vehicle propeller.
										This research allowed me to hone my skills in such things as numerical computation, Lagrangian mechanics, rigid body dynamics, kinematics, and coding environments such as MATLAB.
										Now I am in pursuit of a career path that allows me to continue to learn new things. I hope to find an environment that challenges me and pushes me to grow as an engineer.</p>
